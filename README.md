have used some more up to date features of react (hooks perhaps)
and HTML, (a more flexible solution than tables maybe).
The code was well documented, thanks for all the comments,
but in some places you could have structured it a bit better (separating actions from reducer) and not nesting your scss too much (rather use a method like BEM).
